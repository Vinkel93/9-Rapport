\section{Linear parameter estimation} 
\label{LinParamEst}

%As can be seen in \eqref{multistate model_smallsignal}, the small signal model of such a multi-state/ multi-input system consists of two Jacobian matrices, one for the states and one for the inputs to the system. It should be emphasized however that these matrices have to be evaluated at the operating points, at $(\bar{x}, \bar{u})$. It is a reasonable statement since the inputs to the model are the small signal values of OD and differential pressures, dp, from the pumps. Therefore the same excitation to the real test setup can be carried out by taking the operating values into account and by adding them to the small signal values. 

The method that describes the linear parameter estimation is shown in \figref{fig:parame_block_lin}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Parameter identification block diagram for the linear system. }
\label{fig:parame_block_lin}
\end{figure}

The small-signal inputs are applied to both the test setup and the model. The linearized model is compared to the real system, therefore the operating point is taken into account as the model is small-signal. Since the linear model is only valid for small deviations around the operating point, the real system has to be excited around the same operating point to stay within the limits of the model. In order to achieve it, the operating values are added to both the input and the output such as: 

\begin{equation}
u_{sys} = \bar{u} + \hat{u}
 \label{u_smallsignal}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\hat{u}$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\bar{u}$ \\
and \hspace*{0.7mm} $u_{s}$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the small-signal input, \\
is the operating value of the input,\\
is the input to the real-life system. 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{bar}$
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{bar}$
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{bar}$
\end{minipage} 

And:

\begin{equation}
  y_{s} = \bar{y} + \hat{y}_{sys} 
 \label{u_smallsignal}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\hat{y}_{s}$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\bar{u}_{s}$ \\
and \hspace*{0.7mm} $y_{s}$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the small-signal output from the real-life system, \\
is the operating value of the output,\\
is the output from the real-life system. 
\end{minipage}

\vspace*{2mm}

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{bar}$
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{bar}$
\end{minipage} 

For the linear parameter estimation, the same problem is solved as it is shown in \eqref{ObjectiveFunction11}. In this case, the parameters are varied according to the comparison of the small-signal outputs.  

\subsection{Model Parameters}
\label{estimateParameters}
In order to obtain a complete model of the physical setup, all the parameters describing the components have to be defined. In \secref{SubSecEstimation} a detailed
description of the known parameters of the system has been done. 
In the linearized state-space model, more parameters have to be identified
due to the introduction of the operating points. Hence, in the current chapter a detailed description of the unknown parameters of the physical water distribution setup is carried out.


\textbf{Unknown Parameters}\\
The unknown parameters are related with the form losses, $k_f$, and form friction ,$f$, of the pipes. Despite they are provided by the manufactures they need to be estimated. 
The form losses depend on the fittings and bends of the pipes, which are not always known. 
The friction losses depend on the average inside roughness of the pipes, $\epsilon$, which can change its value due buildups inside pipes or fittings or material change over time. 

%The friction and form losses are part of the model of a pipe, and are given by the following equation
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \lambda (q) =  \frac{8fL}{\pi^{2}gD^5} \rho g  |q| q + k_f \frac{8}{\pi^2gD^4} \rho g |q| q
%  \label{frictionestimation}
%\end{equation}

%From the above equation it can be seen that either estimating only for $k_f$ or $f$ will have the same result in the value of $\lambda (q)$.
%Therefore, it has been decided to carry out the estimation of the total value of $\lambda (q)$, hence discarding the respective values of $k_f$ and $f$.

The operating points of the flow through the chords, $\bm{\bar{z}}$, is also unknown. These values, which correspond to the $8$ flow chords, are introduced in the linearized expression of both pipes 
and valves, see \eqref{lambda_lin} and \eqref{mu_lin}. Thus, not only pipe parameters introduce uncertainties into the system model but also the lack of knowledge of the chord operating points.

Consequently, it has been decided to estimate the total expression for the pressure across the pipes and valves in order to reduce the amount of unknowns in the system.

The system has $15$ pipes in total, from \eqref{lambda_lin}, it can be seen that either tunning for $k_f$, $f$ or $\bm{\bar{z}}$ will have the same result for the total
value of the pressure across the pipes, $\lambda(\bm{{B_1^{T}}}\bm{z})$. For this reason the pressure across the 15 pipes are estimated.

The linearized valve expression, see \eqref{mu_lin}, consists of the term depending on the chord flows, $z$, and the one depending on the $OD$. Both terms include the operating 
point of the chord flows inside them, thus the pressure difference given by both terms, has to be estimated. In the system four valves are used, resulting in eight unknowns in total. 

The WT connection edge, see \eqref{gamma_lin}, is conformed by two valves and one pump. Although the parameters corresponding to the pump are considered as known, the ones 
corresponding to the valves have to be estimated. Resulting in two more unknowns for the system. 

In total, the system has $24$ unknown terms which is calculated following the estimation process described in the next section.
\subsection{Measurements on the test setup}
\label{LinParamEst_measurements}

In order to adjust the state-space model, derived in \chapref{SystemLin}, according to physical setup, an estimation for the parameters defined in \secref{estimateParameters}
is carried out.

From the system setup, nine different relative pressures can be measured, following \figref{systemdiagram} notation the sensors are placed in: 
$n_2$ $n_4$ $n_5$ $n_7$ $n_{10}$ $n_{11}$ $n_{15}$ $n_{16}$ $n_{18}$. The estimation will be done only regarding the four PMA pressures and the pressure in the WT. This is chosen since those are the outputs that will be controlled in \secref{SystemLin_control}. Thus, the estimation will only focus on obtaining the best fit for the outputs relevant in the control part. 

The relationship between pressures, where $\Delta p_{CXX}$ describes the pressure difference for the XX component, is obtained in the same way as in \secref{SubSecEstimation} and are defined as:

\text{\underline{Node 10}}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin {equation}
     y_1 = \Delta p_{C24} 
\end{equation}

\text{\underline{Node 11}}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin {equation}
     y_2 = \Delta p_{C20} + \Delta p_{C21} 
\end{equation}


\text{\underline{Node 15}}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin {equation}
     y_3 = \Delta p_{C31} 
\end{equation}

\text{\underline{Node 16}}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin {equation}
     y_4 = \Delta p_{C28} + \Delta p_{C20}  
\end{equation}

There is no need to define a relation with a referent point for the WT node, since the pressure across the WT is the state of the state-space model. 


\subsection{Linear Estimation Outcomes}

Obtaining a precise model from parameter estimation that describes all aspects of the system well, has been proven challenging. A number of different parameter estimation approaches concerning estimation parameters and data choices has been performed.   

The first attempt is based on a relative short data set with both valve and pump input variations and a complete duration of approximately 15 minutes. Here the $24$ terms defining the pressure across the unknowns edges are estimated. In \appref{LinResults_worst} the results of the estimation are presented.
From the tests a different behavior between the model and the data from the setup is observed at some time intervals. This dissimilar behavior showing up at some time samples deems it incorrect to be used in a model based control scheme. 

In light of the above observations, a different approach for the parameter estimation is attempted. In \secref{estimateParameters} it is described how the unknown pressures across the edges are estimated in order to build up the state-space matrices of the system. As the estimation did not succeed it is decided to estimate the final values of the state-space matrices stated in \eqref{statespace_1}, where $M$ is a symmetric matrix.

Altogether these matrices sum up to 28 unknown parameters, which are the ones to be estimated, furthermore the data duration is extended to approximately 38 minutes to capture more of the system dynamics. In \appref{LinResults_2} the results of this estimation technique is displayed. 
The obtained model now fits the behavior of the system during the whole dataset and the fit is significantly better than the previous model. However the model fit is in the case of note 16 still not satisfying. 
Furthermore are the model dynamics of the system too fast compared to real world measurements found in \appref{sec:WT_TimeConstant}. The time constant of the system is 19.25 minutes based on step response measurements, where the obtained model based on the parameter estimated matrices has a settling time under 15 seconds.

Due to these model misbehaviors it is chosen to change the used estimation data. The new data has a duration of eight hours in order to catch more of the dynamics. Furthermore, only one input is changed at a time and the system inputs are returned to their respective operating point values before a new input step is applied. Thus can each type of input change be distinguished from each other in the output data. 

%Using the same estimation procedure of estimating the final values of the state-space matrices stated in \eqref{statespace_1}, results in poor results and a significantly worse model. Thus another estimation approach is attempted. 
%Instead of estimating the final value of the matrices stated in \eqref{statespace_1} it is chosen to estimate the final values of the complete state space matrices stated in \eqref{statespace_4} and \eqref{outputfinaleq}.               

The model outputs to be compared with the test data are reduced to the WT, note 10 and note 15, in order to facilitate the data gathering due to connection problems at the test setup when running longer tests. The toolbox used for estimating remains the same. 

To obtain satisfying results by this approach the estimation process is divided into two parts. 
The first part estimates the system matrices from \eqref{statespace_1} to fit only the behavior of the WT. From this estimation the final result for these matrices are thus obtained, as the state in this part is the only output from the model.

The next part consists of estimating the remaining system matrices from \eqref{statespace_6} to fit the output behavior described by note 10 and 15. From this the final result for $ \bm{C_{p,1}} $ and $ \bm{C_{p,2}}$ is obtained. 

In the following both the inputs and the results obtained by this approach is shown.

\textbf{Estimation Data}

As the estimation is based on a linearized model an operating point for the system is chosen. This point is based on the WT being approximately half full which allows for an equal amount of deviation in both directions. For the chosen operating point, data is gathered from the system while small steps are individually applied to the two main pumps and the opening degree of the PMA valves. In order to use the data for parameter estimation the operating point is subtracted, leaving only small-signal values.  

The operating point of the PMA valves is placed at $70\%$ opening corresponding to $63^{\circ}$ and the small-signal values for the estimation can be seen in \figref{fig:est_OD_data_final}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/tikz/est_OD_data_final.tex} 
\caption{Small-signal values of the opening degrees of the PMA valves.}
\label{fig:est_OD_data_final}
\end{figure}

To achieve a 50\% fill level of the WT in steady state combined with the chosen operating point of the valves, the operating point of the two inlet pumps, C2 and C16, has to be set at a differential pressure of $\Delta p = 0.2 \text{[bar]}$. The required operating point is found by experimental tests made on the setup. The small-signal values used in the estimation are shown in \figref{fig:est_deltap_data_final}.

\end{figure}



\textbf{Estimation Result}
\label{estim_results}

The following figures show the comparison between the data obtained from the lab and the outputs of the model with the estimated parameters.

With the estimated parameters it is seen that the model follows the behavior of the measured data and that the fit percentage is within a decent margin. 
Based on these results, the system model and the parameters contained inside can now be used for control purposes, as a description approximating the 
system is obtained.
