\subsection{Pump model} 
\label{PumpModel}
In order to move water from the reservoirs to the consumers, pumping is required. To guarantee that the water reaches every end-user with the appropriate pressure, different pumps can be used in the water distribution system.\\
Centrifugal pumps are suitable for this purpose, as the output is steady and consistent. 
%They generate pressure within they guarantee a constant flow of water at a constant pressure for any given set of conditions. 
A model describing the pressure drop is derived which is presented in detail in \cite{Phd_Carsten}. The pressure provided by the pump is given by:
%\todo{The list bellow should be with units.}

\begin{equation}
  \Delta p = -a_{h2}{q_p}^2 + a_{h1} \omega_r q_p + a_{h0}{\omega_r}^2
  \label{eq:PumpModel}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\Delta p$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $a_{h2}$, $a_{h1}$, $a_{h0}$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $q_p$ \\
and \hspace*{0.7mm} $\omega_r$

The pump model is based on the parameters $a_{h2}$, $a_{h1}$, $a_{h0}$, which are provided in the data sheet and are scaled to units of pressure in [bar] and the unit for flow in ${[\frac{m^3}{h}]}$.

\subsubsection*{Hydraulic power and efficiency}
\label{pump_power}
In order to minimize the running cost of the pumps, it is necessary to know the power consumption. The electricity consumption of the pump, as a function of flow, $q_p$, is described in \cite{master_aau}. This expression can be used to calculate the efficiency $\eta$. By assuming $\eta$ to be constant the expression becomes simpler, however $\eta$ must be chosen within the operating area of the pump. The electrical power can then be calculated by taking the hydraulic power generated by the pumps and the efficiency of the pumps into account.

The hydraulic power generated by a pump can be described by an equivalent to Joule's law, that is in terms of the pressure difference across the pump, multiplied with the flow through it, see \eqref{eq:Hyd_Pow}.

%\subsubsection*{Pump power consumption}
%\todo{We need to redo this part and somehow include the derivation of the first two equations!}
\begin{equation}
P_h = \Delta p \cdot q_p 
\label{eq:Hyd_Pow}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $P_h$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the hydraulic power.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{W}$\\
\end{minipage}	

The electrical power used for running the pump can then be described through the relation between the hydraulic power and the efficiency, $\eta$. This can be seen in \eqref{eq:effic_pump}.

\begin{equation}
P_e = \frac{1}{\eta}\cdot\Delta p \cdot q_p 
\label{eq:effic_pump}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $P_e$\\
and \hspace*{0.7mm} $\eta$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the power consumption of the pump,\\
is the efficiency of the pump.

\eqref{eq:effic_pump} is used in a \secref{control_problem} to minimize the cost of running the system. 


% In \secref{introduction} it has been introduced the aim of the project, consisting on minimizing the power consumption of the pumps in order to reduce 
% the cost of running the hydraulic setup. Therefore, a model of the pump power consumption is needed so it can be used afterwards. In \cite{Phd_Carsten} 
% an expression for the torque produced in a centrifugal pump is derived. 
% In \secref{introduction}, the aim of this project has been specified which consists of minimizing the electrical price of running the hydraulic setup, while maintaining a pressure within a limit. 
% A model of the pump power consumption is therefore needed.

% In \cite{Phd_Carsten}, an expression for the torque produced in a centrifugal pump is derived. 

% \begin{equation}
%   \tau = -a_{t2}{q_i}^2 + a_{t1} {\omega}_r {q_i} + a_{t0} {{\omega}_r}^2
%   \label{pumptorque}
% \end{equation}

% \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
% Where\\
% \hspace*{8mm} $a_{t2}$, $a_{t1}$, $a_{t0}$ \\
% \hspace*{8mm} $q_i$ \\
% and \hspace*{0.7mm} $\omega_r$ 

% \end{minipage}
% \begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
% \vspace*{2mm}
% are constants describing the pump\\
% is the volume flow through the impeller,\\
% is the impeller speed.

% \textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m^3}{s}}$\\

% \end{minipage}	

% Making use of the relation between torque and electrical power, $P_e = \tau \omega$, the above expression can be rewritten in terms of electrical 
% power. 

% \begin{equation}
%   P_e = -a_{t2}{q_i}^2{\omega}_r + a_{t1} {{\omega}_r}^2 {q_i} + a_{t0} {{\omega}_r}^3
%   \label{pumptorque}
% \end{equation}
