\section{Verification of model}
\label{verification_of_model}

A model of the water distribution system is obtained, linearized, \secref{Linearization}, the parameters are estimated, \secref{LinParamEst}, the model is arranged on state-space form, \secref{SystemLin_control}, and finally discretized, \secref{discrete_SS}. In this section the model is excited in different ways, to consider if the behavior can be deemed reasonable compared to the test setup. First the time constant for the system is compared to real measurements, then an input is applied to both pumps in order to see how the pressure at the CP changes and then the disturbance, given as OD of the valves, is changed to see how the pressure at the CP changes. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \input{report/tikz/simulation_time_constant.tex}
    \caption{The first plot shows a small-signal simulation where a step is applied to both pumps in the final model. The second plot shows the measurement described in \appref{sec:WT_TimeConstant}.}
    \label{simulation_time_constant}
\end{figure}

At \figref{simulation_time_constant} a positive step is applied to both the model and the real system. As it can be seen the pressure rises, meaning that the level of the WT rises. Furthermore the time constant is marked with a blue dot on both plots. From this a time constant for the simulation of 903 seconds, and a time constant for the real system of 1155 seconds are obtained. Thus the model is faster than the system but within a reasonable range.

    \label{input_simulation}
\end{figure}

At \figref{input_simulation}, a series of steps is applied to the model of the main pumps and the pressure change at the CP is plotted. Here it is seen that when a positive step is applied, the pressure at the PMAs increases positively, and the opposite with a negative step. Furthermore, it is seen that there is a pressure different between CP1, node 10, and CP2, node 15. This is also expected because of the physical height difference.  

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
    \input{report/tikz/disturbance_simulation.tex}
    \caption{A series of steps are applied to the valves and it can be seen that the PMA pressure follows as expected.}
    \label{disturbance_simulation}
\end{figure}

At \figref{disturbance_simulation} a series of steps are applied to the valves, in order to see how a change in disturbance affects the pressure at the CP. Here a pressure drop is seen when OD is increased and an increase in pressure when OD is lowered. This behavior corresponds to the expected as opening a valve at constant differential pump pressure should decrease the PMA pressure and vice versa.

Based on these three tests the overall behavior of the model is validated as the model behaves correctly and consists of the same dynamic properties as the test setup.
