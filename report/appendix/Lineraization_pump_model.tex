\chapter{Pump linearization and PI controller}
\label{cha:linear_pump}

The control structure chosen in \chapref{control_problem} and \figref{fig:control_structure} includes a PI controller at each pump, which is to be designed. The PI controllers purpose is to ensure that the associated pump is providing a specified differential pressure. For the two main pumps, this differential pressure reference is specified by the MPC. For the two pma pumps the reference is constant and the PI controller thereby ensures that these pumps retain a constant lift. 

The control focus of this project has been on the model predictive control, see \secref{sec:MPC}. Therefore a simple PI controller has been designed, where the control structure can be seen on \figref{fig:simple_PI}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The output from the MPC is a differential pressure, which is to be controlled through the rotational speed of the pumps. The model for the pumps is explained in \secref{PumpModel} and defined as,

\begin{equation*}
\Delta p = -a_{h2}{q_i}^2 + a_{h1} \omega_r q_i + a_{h0}{\omega_r}^2
\end{equation*}

which is a nonlinear model. By the assumption that the flow is constant, the expression can through a Taylor expansion be linearized, with respect to $\omega$, to a small signal model.


For simplification the pump model is separated into smaller chunks, see \eqref{eq:tay_1}, then Taylor approximated, see \eqref{eq:tay_2}, where $\omega = \hat{\omega}+\bar{\omega}$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f_1(\bar{\omega}) &= a_{h1}\bar{q}\bar{\omega} \\
f_2(\bar{\omega}) &= a_{h0}\bar{\omega}^2
\end{split}
\label{eq:tay_1}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f_{t1}(\omega) &= f_1(\bar{\omega}) + f_1'(\bar{\omega})\cdot(\omega - \bar{\omega}) \\
f_{t2}(\omega) &= f_2(\bar{\omega}) + f_2'(\bar{\omega})\cdot(\omega - \bar{\omega})
\end{split}
\label{eq:tay_2}
\end{equation}

From \eqref{eq:tay_1} an expression for the workspace of, $\bar{\Delta P}$, can be made.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{\Delta P} = f_{1}(\bar{\omega}) + f_{2}(\bar{\omega}) + c
\end{split}
\label{eq:tay_3}
\end{equation}

The linear pump model can then be expressed as seen in \eqref{eq:tay_4}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
0 &= -(\bar{\Delta P} + \hat{\Delta P}) + f_{t1}(\bar{\omega}) + f_{t2}(\bar{\omega}) + c\\
  &= -(f_{1}(\bar{\omega}) + f_{2}(\bar{\omega}) + c + \hat{\Delta P}) + f_{t1}(\bar{\omega}) + f_{t2}(\bar{\omega}) + c \\ 
  &= -\hat{\Delta P} + f_1'(\bar{\omega})\cdot\hat{\omega} + f_2'(\bar{\omega})\cdot\hat{\omega}
\end{split}
\label{eq:tay_4}
\end{equation}

\eqref{eq:tay_4} is then Laplace transformed and solved for the input output relationship as seen on \figref{fig:simple_PI}

\begin{equation}
G(s) = \frac{\hat{\Delta P}}{\hat{\omega}} = f'_1(\bar{\omega}) + f'_2(\bar{\omega}) = a_{h1}\bar{q} + 2a_{h0}\bar{\omega}
\label{eq:lin_pump_simon}
\end{equation}

With the following operating points set for the pumps, the differential pressure over the pumps and their respective valves are measured. 

\begin{equation}
\centering
	\begin{split}
	\bar{\omega}_{C18} &= 0.16,\hspace{20pt} \Delta P_{C18} = 0.0807 \\
	\bar{\omega}_{C25} &= 0.4,\hspace{20pt} \Delta P_{C25} = 0.255  \\
	\bar{\omega}_{C2}  &= 0.4,\hspace{20pt} \Delta P_{C2} = 0.2 \\
	\bar{\omega}_{C16} &= 0.4,\hspace{20pt} \Delta P_{C16} =0.25 
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

To estimate the flow, q, through the pumps, the small signal pressure has to be found. With the relation $\Delta P = \bar{\Delta} P + \hat{\Delta} P$, the linear small signal deviation, $\hat{\Delta} P$ can be found through measurements, where the $\hat{\omega}$ has been chosen to $0.05$.  

From \secref{sec:small_sig_pump} the small signal deviation measurement and test procedure can be found. The result of these measurement is stated below.

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\frac{\hat{\Delta P_{C_2}}}{\hat{\omega_{C_2}}} = 1.376   \\
	\frac{\hat{\Delta P_{C_16}}}{\hat{\omega_{C_2}}} =  0.704 \\
	\frac{\hat{\Delta P_{C_18}}}{\hat{\omega_{C_2}}} =  1.473 \\
	\frac{\hat{\Delta P_{C_25}}}{\hat{\omega_{C_2}}} = 1.338
	\end{split}	
\end{equation*}

The flow can then be estimated through the linearized model in \eqref{eq:lin_pump_simon}, as a normal equation with one unknown variable, see \eqref{eq:operating_point_flow_pump}.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\bar{q_{C_{n}}}  &= \frac{\frac{\hat{\Delta P}}{\hat{\omega} }-2a_{h0}\bar{\omega}}{a_{h1}}\\
	\bar{q_{C_{2}}} &= 42.25\\
	\bar{q_{C_{16}}} &= -26.31\\
	\bar{q_{C_{18}}} &= -70.70\\
	\bar{q_{C_{25}}} &= -32.77
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:operating_point_flow_pump}
\end{equation}



% From this the flow through the pumps can be estimated from the linearized pump model, by solving for q. 



% \begin{equation}
% \centering
% \begin{split}
% q_{C18} &= 0.179 \hspace{20pt} q_{C25} &= 0.272 \hspace{20pt} q_{C2} &= 0.061 \hspace{20pt} q_{C16} &= 0.169
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}

% By inserting the values for the linearized model in \eqref{eq:lin_pump_simon}, the final models ends up as gains. 

% \begin{equation}
% \centering
% 	\begin{split}
% 	G_{C18}(s) &= 0.218 \hspace{20pt} G_{C25}(s) &= 0.548 \hspace{20pt} G_{C2}(s) &= 0.962 \hspace{20pt} G_{C16}(s) &= 0.963
% 	\end{split}
% \end{equation}

% As it can be seen in \todo{add secref} is the dynamic of the system slow. Therefore will a controller that can react within 3-5 seconds be fast enough.
% By using the Matlab design tool box for dynamical systems and having the settling time of 3 seconds in mind, the gains for the PI controller can be found as shown in \eqref{eq:PI_GAINS}. 
% Due to high similarities between these controllers only one step response in shown on \figref{fig:Tikz_PI_PUMP_GAIN}.

% \end{figure}

% \subsection*{PI test}

% The PI controller was implemented on the water system described in \chapref{system_overview}. From the test it where concluded that some tuning of the gains had to be done, due to large overshoots and marginal stabilities on some of the pumps. The final values where found by trail and errors and can be seen in \eqref{eq:NEW_PI_GAINS}. 

% \begin{equation}
% \centering
% 	\begin{split}
% 	K_{C18} &= 6 \hspace{20pt} K_{C25} &= 4 \hspace{20pt} K_{C2} &= 1.4 \hspace{20pt} K_{C16} &= 1.4
% 	\end{split}
% 	\label{eq:NEW_PI_GAINS}
% \end{equation}

% Whit these gains the systems gets a slower response than the settling time of 4 seconds. However this is still deemed fit to this project, since dynamics of the WT is much slower.
