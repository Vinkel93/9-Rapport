\section{System time constant}
\label{sec:WT_TimeConstant}

\subsection*{Purpose:}
The purpose of this test is to determine the time constant and settling time of the water distribution network.


%\subsection{One clamp push} % \label{app:...}
\subsection*{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The water distribution system at AAU [AAU No: 100911]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure:}
The following procedure was made for finding the time constant:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wait for the system to get into a steady state position with the following system setup: valve opening at $0.7 \%$ for all consumer valves and differential pressure over pumps at $C2 = C16 = 0.2$[bar], $C18 = 0.1 $[bar], $C25 = 0.25$[bar].
\item Increase the differential pressure over C2 with 0.1[bar].
\item Wait 1.5 hour for the level in the WT to settle.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Measuring data:}
The measurements data can be found on the attached storage under the path: \path{CD:/Data/WT timeconstant}, a plot of the data is shown in \figref{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant}.

\subsection*{Results:}

The time constant of the system can be found through the linear differential equation shown in \eqref{statespace_4}. By Laplace transform and solving for the input output relation, the standard form of the transfer function for the system can be derived as see in \eqref{eq:std_trans_tank_time}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	&\Delta \dot{p}_{wt} = A_p \Delta \hat{p}_{wt}  + \pmb{B_p}\pmb{\hat{u}}\\
	&s\Delta p_{wt}(s) = A_p \Delta \hat{p}_{wt}(s)  + \pmb{B_p}\pmb{\hat{u}(s)}\\
	&\frac{\Delta p_{wt}(s)}{u(s)} = \frac{B}{s-A} = \frac{\frac{B}{A}}{\frac{1}{A}s + 1}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:std_trans_tank_time}
\end{equation}

From the denominator, the time constant of the system can be directly read as seen in \eqref{eq:direct_time_constant}

\begin{equation}
	\tau s + 1
	\label{eq:direct_time_constant}
\end{equation}

 Since A in \eqref{statespace_4} is a scalar, due to the first order model only having one state, the system has one time constant. 

As the dynamics of the water distribution network are described by a first order system, the time constant can be found as the time the system uses to reach $63.2\%$ of the steady state pressure.
This pressure at $63.2\%$ of the steady state values is based on the minimum and maximum pressure values during the step and determined to:

\begin{equation}
(0.137 - 0.127)\cdot63.2 \% = 0.0063 \rightarrow 0.127 + 0.0063 = 0.133 \unit{bar} 
\end{equation}

Based on the data is it determined that at a pressure of 0.133 bar has 1155 seconds passed which corresponds to 19,25 minutes, thus the time constant is determined. 
On \figref{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant} the measurement data used to determine the time constant of the WT is shown. A small red dot indicates the time constant for the tank.

\label{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant}
\end{figure}

% Based on the determined time constant and the first order model, the settling time of the tank can be found as $1155\cdot 5 = 5775$ seconds equal to 1.6 hours.

\subsection*{Uncertainties of measurement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The settling time for the initial state was not reached after 1.5 hours, which would affect the calculated time constant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion:}
From this test the time constant is determined. The results is based on the fact that the water distribution network dynamics can be described by a first order system, thereby is the time constant found by applying a step to the system and determined to be 19,25 minutes.
