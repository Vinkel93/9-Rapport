\section{Control Problem}
\label{control_problem}
%\vspace{-1mm}
The water distribution system described in \secref{system_overview} is to be controlled with respect to the requirements and constraints stated in \secref{Requirements_and_constraints} and the dynamics of the system described in \secref{SystemLin_control}. For a better clearance, the requirements and constraints are stated again:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Consumer pressure requirements %$0.08 < \bm{y} < 0.14 \:[\text{bar}]$
%
	\item Minimizing the total running costs
%
	\item Performance constraints on the pumps
\end{itemize}

%The WT is used in the system to reduce the operation cost of the water distribution network. Therefor the system has to be controlled in a way that obtains the lowest cost of operation. 
The system consists of four pumps and is controlled by the two placed in the main ring. The two pumps in the PMAs influence only the operating point with a fixed pressure lift. 

The project deals with a control scheme that minimizes the cost of running the system, by controlling the main pumps and using the WT, such that the pressure at the end-users is maintained. In other words, the use of the main pumps and the WT is controlled according to the constraints and requirements stated above. 

In order to achieve such an optimal behavior, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is considered. With MPC, the dynamics of the model, knowledge about prices and end-user consumption are used to predict the system behavior subject to the constraints in the system. 

Apart from the MPC control, all pumps are controlled by PI controllers in order to deliver the required differential pressure. The MPC could be used to control the main pumps directly, but to mimic a real world scenario, without PMA pumps, it is chosen to let the MPC set differential pressure references to the main pumps. As a consequence of the chosen control method, the following cascade structure is formulated for the two main pumps as it is shown in \figref{fig:control_structure}: 

%However, as it is explained above, the two main pumps are also controlled by MPC.

\end{figure}

The PI controllers are responsible for setting the control inputs to the main pumps, using the feedback from the differential pressure output. It should be noted that typically the flow out of the pumping station is controlled instead of the pressure. Here the use of pressure feedback has the advantage that in case of system failure the pressure is what matters. The flow would typically either lead to high or low pressure or it will make the WT overflow. The reference to the PI controllers is set by the MPC algorithm, which takes the measurements from the output into account. The references are set as differential pressures. One of the advantages of such a cascade control is that the pump controllers are present at each pump, also including the PMA pumps. At the event of implementation or communication failure between the MPC and the pump controllers, the pumping remains operational.

%% Comment Carsten 
%Typically the flow out of the pumping station is controlled. Here you use the pressure with has some obvious advantages:
%- In the case of a system failure it is the pressure that is important. The flow will typically either lead to too high or too low pressure, or tank run over. 

%This is an important change, which you should emphasize.

%For the MPC the systems operating area, $C_T(\pmb{\Delta{p}},\pmb{q},\Gamma(k))$ has to be described. 
In order to define an objective function for the MPC problem, the cost of running the system has to be taken into account based on the power consumption of the pumps and the electrical price. Such an objective function can be written in the form: 
%
\begin{align}
 \Upsilon(\bm{u}[k],\bm{q_p}[k],c_p[k]) &= \frac{1}{\eta} \sum_{i=1}^{H_p-1} \Big( \bm{u^T}[k+i|k] \cdot  \bm{q_{p}}[k+i|k]\Big)\cdot c_p[k+i|k] \label{eqcost} 
\end{align}
%
%Then considering the total cost of running the system multiple things have to be taken into consideration. Both the model of the water distribution network, the electrical consumption of the pumps, the electrical pricing and the constraints of the system have to be taken into account. Furthermore a constraints securing that the WT do not run dry or overflow is included. By considering the total cost of running, $C_T$, this can be seen as a minimization problem:
%\todo{The output \textbf{y} is the 8 pressure measurements, here also including $p_{cp}$ and $\Delta{p}_i$ so the notation here need to correcting.}
%\todo{Furthermore the model have to be discreet and we need to correct $\Delta p$ compared to u.}

It should be pointed out that the input and flow variables of the objective function are not small-signal values since the energy is to be optimized. Therefore the deviation from the operating point would not result in the total amount of energy consumed by the pumps. 

The efficiency of the two main pumps is assumed to be the same as the pumps are of the same type. Furthermore, the efficiency is considered to be constant since the operating point is the same for the main pumps and it is assumed that for small deviations in flow and pressure the efficiency does not vary significantly. 
The control problem is formulated as a minimization problem of the form:
%\pmb{u}[k],\pmb{q_p}[k],c[k]
\begin{align}
\underset{\bm{u}}{min} \:  \Upsilon(\bm{u}[k],\bm{q_p}[k],c_p[k]) &= \underset{\bm{u}}{min} \: \frac{1}{\eta} \sum_{i=0}^{H_p-1} \Big( \bm{u^T}[k+i|k] \cdot \bm{q_{p}}[k+i|k]\Big)\cdot c_p[k+i|k] \label{eqcost1} \\

As it is shown in \eqref{eqcost1} the optimal input signal is obtained such that the cost of running the pumps is minimized. Therefore, the objective function gives a price for all the consumed power over the control horizon, which is a specific future time interval. No direct information about the flows through the pumps are available, therefore the flows need to be expressed as other variables, leading to the problem being reformulated.

The minimization is subject to the dynamics of the water distribution network, and the constraints. The constraint on the output of the system, is considered as the pressure demand for the end-users. Furthermore, two constraints to the pressure in the WT and the input signal to the pumps are present. 
%There is a constraint on the pressure in the WT which represents the states in the dynamics and furthermore, there is a constraint on the input signal to the pumps.
%The dynamic model of the system is explained in \chapref{modelling} and linearized in \secref{LinParamEst}. The electrical price, $c_p[k]$, is described in \appref{sec:cost_fkt}. %From this the input vector $\pmb{u}$ should be obtained, so the cost of running the system, within the bounds of the constrains, is minimized. 

In the following sections the design of the control system is explained. 


%The purpose is to let the WT do the work when the price of running the pumps are high.

%\begin{align*}

%\end{align*}


% The pressure at a given CP can be controlled by the water level in the WT which is controlled by the rotational speed of the pumps. To fulfill the requirement of a minimum pressure at a given CP the water level in the WT have to be within a operations area. A controller have to be develop that takes the pressure actuators into account. 

% The flow through the WT is controlled by pressure in the outer ring. Whenever the pressure is higher in the outer ring than in the WT, water is being pump into the WT. Furthermore the average flow rate, $\bar{q}_{wt}$, through the WT must meet the minimum requirement to insure the water quality. This can be seen as a constrain of the operation area of the system. 

% At the same time the total cost of running the system should be minimized. Therefor a cost function is needed. This cost function purpose is to find the optimal control signal which minimize the cost of running the pumps. Thereby spending the least money on running the total system.
