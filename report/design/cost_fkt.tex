\chapter{Electrical price}\label{sec:cost_fkt} %\todotom{I think it is a good idea to treat the data below as if it were a prediction of the future prices.
%W.r.t. the term 'cost function', I think it's a bit misplaced here. What you have in the graph is the cost-of-energy as a function of time. However, when you use the term 'cost function' it might be confused with the term 'objective function', which in your case will be the product between the cost-of-energy and the energy consumed.}

To minimize the running cost of the system, the power consumption of the pumps, $P_e$ Cf. \secref{PumpModel}, and the electrical price, $c_p[k]$, is considered. Predicting future prices is an extensive task that depends on many factors e.g user consumption and weather conditions. Due to the fact that the main focus of this project is not to derive a high precision predictive model that describe future electrical prices, data is used from \cite{Electrical_price} instead. The price function can be seen in \figref{fig:electrical_price}. 


% Due to the fact that the learning goals of this project is not to derive a high precision predictive model that describe future electrical prices, a simple model that mimics real electrical pricing is created. This model is based on electrical pricing in Denmark from the period 27-03-2017 to 02-04-2017.  


% To predict future prices a simple moving average (SMA) is used.
% This approach have been chosen, .

% The SMA uses present and previous data samples to calculate future predictions, this can be expressed as seen in \eqref{equ:MA}.
	
% \begin{equation}
% x(k+1) = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} x(-k)
% \label{equ:MA}
% \end{equation} 

% The SMA can not take non-stationary processes into account, so if sudden changes in the price appears, the future estimates will be less precise. From \cite{Electrical_price} data price over the present has been gathered and can be seen on \figref{fig:electrical_price} together with the SMA model which utilize the previous data sample and the present.

As this is a real data from a given period, most likely it does not fit the pricing in any other given week, as the pricing is fluctuating a lot from day to day. However, the data indicates that the pricing is higher in the morning and evening which is applicable for any given week and thereby is a general property of the time dependent pricing. This behavior can be seen as the periodicity of the data with two peaks a day. The chosen data thus gives a realistic idea of the improvement of the controller which can be achieved in a real world scenario based on the week on which the data is recorded.  

%However $\frac{1}{\eta}\cdot\Delta p \cdot q \cdot \Gamma(k)$ 

% Even though the pricing seen in \figref{fig:electrical_price} is not a prediction of the future electrical pricing it is assumed to be a good representation of the pricing and therefor it will be used for this project.
