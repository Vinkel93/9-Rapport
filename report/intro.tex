Water pressure management is a vital part of the water supply infrastructure all over the world. It ensures that an appropriate water pressure is present such that the consumers are supplied with water at all time. Maintaining a minimum pressure in the network is an important task as it ensures the end-user a decent water pressure and also minimizes the risk of contamination in the water system\cite{national2005public}.

In the U.S alone, 4 \% of the national energy consumption is used on moving and treating water or wastewater\cite{appelbaum2002water}. %
%
%The current environmental situation that our world is facing has lead to an increase in the care of the planet. This concern has yielded to the rise of green energies, augmenting the amount of renewable energy sources 
%
With an increasing focus on green energy, more renewable energy sources are added to the grid. Nevertheless, the intermittent behavior of renewable sources and time-dependent consumer preferences result in fluctuation of the available power.
This means that the price for electric power also varies \cite{fluctuating_price}. To minimize the cost of running a water distribution network, potential stored energy can be used to maintain a minimum pressure. When electric prices are low, water can be pumped to a higher altitude and stored in a water tower(WT), thereby storing energy for future use. The potential energy of the water stored in the WT can then be used to maintain a minimum pressure that is required at the end-consumers. However, when a WT is included in a water distribution network, the pressure in the system is defined by the water level and the physical properties of the WT. This means that in order to control pressure, the water level in the WT should be controlled.  

The maximum allowed pressure in water distribution networks has to be considered as the risk of water leakage increases when pressure is increased\cite{feldman2009aspects}. Thus increased water losses due to leakage leads to a higher energy consumption. In \cite{feldman2009aspects} it is stated that the estimated world-wide water loss is at 30 \%, so the energy used on cleaning the water from filth, bacteria and pressurizing it is therefore wasted. Another problem that should be highlighted regarding high pressure is that high pressure increases the wear on the pipes\cite{Watts_water}, which can lead to higher maintenance costs as pipes and fittings have to be replaced more frequently. Additionally, regular maintenance is not always possible, since pipes usually are placed underneath the ground and need to be dug up. Thereby the expense of maintenance is increased, especially in urban areas, were the operation can have a negative impact on significant infrastructures. Based on these facts, the maximum pressure in a water distribution network is a vital parameter of the profitability of the system. In a system with a WT, the maximum allowed pressure is defined by the maximum allowed water level in the WT, as the WT in most situations is able to provide a dominant pressure compared to the desired network pressure.

Some constraints regarding the solutions dealing with a WT are necessary to be taken into account. One of them being the quality of the water in the tower. If stored for too long, the quality starts to decrease due to decreasing oxygen level \cite{Lenntech,DO}. Thus the water should not be stored for too long. The oxygen level of the water also depends on the water temperature and therefore the water should not be too warm. Furthermore, it is undesirable that the water remains stagnant in the tower or pipe as it also affects the water quality.

The considerations above lead to the following problem statement:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{How can a water tower be implemented in a water distribution network and controlled to minimize the cost of running the distribution network without violating constraints and compromising the water quality.}
\end{itemize}

% Implementing one large pressure pump at the water supply is one solution to this problem. It could pressurize the water to a point such that the end consumers get the pressure needed. However this solution is simple it is not beneficial as the water leakage increases proportional to the pressure\cite{feldman2009aspects}, thus increasing the water losses which leads to a higher energy consumption. In \cite{feldman2009aspects} it is stated that the estimated world wide water loss is at 30 \%, so the energy used on cleaning the water for filth, bacteria and pressurizing it is lost. 

%  Thus it is necessary to minimize the pressure to a point, where the end consumer are satisfied and the leakage is kept to a minimum to decrease the losses.\\
% Another problem that should be highlighted to a high pressure is that a high pressure will increase the ware on the pipes in a system\cite{Watts_water}, which leads to higher maintenances as they got to be replaced more often. This is not an easy task, since the pipes usually is under ground and needs to be dug up which is an expensive part, especially in a city since it can have a negative impact on the traffic flow. 


% To reduce the pressure, the water network is separated into subsystems called "pressure management areas" (PMA). Each PMA covers a certain area e.g residential area, industrial area etc with the purpose of controlling the pressure in a specific area. Each PMA includes one or more pressure reduction valves (PRV), which is connected to the water supply. The PRVs reduces the pressure inside the PMA , such that the pressure is kept at a minimum\cite{fallis2011guidelines}. There is a different PRVs, here including fixed and time based. The fixed keep the valve opened at a certain level at all time, where the time based open and closes depending on the flow rate.

Maintaining a minimum pressure in the network is an important task as the end user is ensured a decent water pressure and also for minimizing the risk of contamination in the water system\cite{national2005public}.%, which ensure clean/healthy water to the consumers. %Another important part for the pressure is to make sure that the end consumers also is ensured water.

However this solution is simple it is not beneficial as the water leakage increases proportional to the pressure\cite{feldman2009aspects}, thus increasing the water losses which leads to a higher energy consumption. Before any water is distributed out to the consumers the water got to be prepared e.g cleaned for filth, bacteria etc and then pressurized.

% With an increasing focus green energy, it is wanted to keep the energy consumption to the water distribution network as low as possible. For minimizing the energy on pumps, potential energy can be used. This is where the pump is pumping the water to a higher altitude that the PMA, to a so called water tower. The potential energy stored in the tower is then used to maintain the minimum pressure for the different PMAs. If the pressure however should become to low, the pumps can be activated to increase the pressure again. Some constraints to this solution is still needed to be taken into account. One of them being the quality of the water. If stored for too long the quality of the water will start to decrease due to a decreasing oxygen level [\cite{Lenntech},\cite{DO}], thus the water should not be stored for to long.
