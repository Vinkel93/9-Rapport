\chapter*{Preface}

This report covers the $8^{th}$ semester project at Control and Automation at Aalborg university for the Department of Electronic systems. The project is produced by group 17gr830.\\
The goal of this project is to control and optimize the running cost of a water distribution system, which is extended with a water tower.  

The report starts with a small introduction to the system, how it is modelled and parameters are estimated. This is followed by the simulation, derivation of the controller and implementation. A discussion about ideas of improvement leads up to the final conclusion. 

The reader can find a nomenclature at the beginning of the report which includes acronyms, a symbolic list and a notation list. In the appendix, detailed derivation, an assumption list, relevant measurements used for this project and a complete overview of the test setup can be found.
